            &nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested in many things such as every other person. My dream car is a 2016 Dodge Viper ACR.
            When the first Viper came out in 1996. It had and an 8.5 liter V10 engine and made 600 horsepower.
            It did not come with traction control, ABS, stability control, and not even airbags. It has earned the nickname the Widow Maker for being so dangerous.
            <br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I also love to watch anime. Anime is much different from watching cartoons. The animation is different and so is the plot or story of it.
            Anime has a lot of different categories ranging from rom coms to horror and action. It also to be much more mature than what I used to watch as a kid.
            My all time favorite anime series is the Fate series. It is about multiple mages fighting in a Holy Grail War and the last one left gets thier wish granted.
            The mages summon servants from history, myths, and legends.
