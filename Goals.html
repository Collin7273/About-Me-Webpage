            <p>We all have ambitions and goals we want to achieve. I have set some ambitious goals for myself in the coming years.
                I want move to Japan, learn new languages, develop friendships, get in shape, and improve my technical skills.
                These goals are important to me because they will help me live a more fulfilling life. </br><br>
                Moving to Japan would be a dream come true. I am fascinated by the culture and the music and I would love to experience first hand.
                I believe that language is a powerful tool that helps connect people from different cultures. The language I would like to learn would be Japanese, French, and Italian.</br><br>
                I believe having strong friendships is essential for having a happy life. I want to make more friends and hopefully find the person for me.
                One other goal that I believe to be important is improving my coding skills. I believe that it will me achieve my professional goals that I have for a betteer future.
