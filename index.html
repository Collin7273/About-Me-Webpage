    <p>Welcome to my corner of the Internet. I am 24 years old and will be turning 25 in a couple of months. 
    I am one the middle children in my family. I have an older brother who is 34 years old. My sister is the oldest and she is 26.
    I have a fraternal twin brother who still resides in Geogia with my family.
    I am from small town called Nashville, GA. I recently moved to Washington looking to find myself and seek for more and better opputunites for my future.
    I am currently attending Valdosta State University online. I am a senior and I graduate in Summer of 2024.
